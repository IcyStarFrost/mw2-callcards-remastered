# MW2CC | Modern Warfare 2 Call Cards
A complete rewrite of the old MW2 call cards addon. This rewrite most notably improves upon visual design, internal code functionality, and generally more developer friendly.

*An easy to use panel to select banners/emblems with previews*

## Improvements over the older addon
- Card Queue System
- Lambda Player Support
- Zeta Player Support
- Cleaner code
- Better user experience when selecting new banners/emblems
- Support for animated VTF files


## How to add custom banners/emblems
To add custom emblems, go to and create the directories seen here and place .jpg, .png, and .vtf files in the `emblems` folder: `GarrysMod\sourceengine\materials\mw2cc\custom\emblems`
Likewise for banners, create the directories seen here and place .jpg, .png, and .vtf files in the `banners` folder: `GarrysMod\sourceengine\materials\mw2cc\custom\banners`

Addon creators can share their banners/emblems by simply using the file paths shown. For example, `addonname\materials\mw2cc\custom\emblems`
